# 🧠 Understanding useMemo in React

React's **useMemo** hook is used to *memoize a computed value*, so that it only recalculates when its dependencies change.  
This helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary expensive calculations during re-renders.

## 💡 Why useMemo is Needed

Imagine you have a slow calculation inside a React component.  
Each time the component re-renders, that calculation runs again — even if the inputs haven’t changed!

useMemo fixes that by caching (memoizing) the result.

## 🧩 Basic Syntax

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
