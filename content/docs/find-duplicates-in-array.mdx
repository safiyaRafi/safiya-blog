# 🧠 Find Duplicates in Array

Finding duplicates in an array is one of the most common coding interview questions.  
It checks your understanding of **arrays**, **hashing**, and **time-space trade-offs**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return all elements that appear **more than once**.

### Example
```text
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]

💡 Approach 1: Using Hash Set

We can use a Set to keep track of numbers we've already seen.

If the number is not in the set → add it.

If it is already in the set → it’s a duplicate.

Pseudocode
create empty set seen
create empty list duplicates

for each num in nums:
    if num in seen:
        add num to duplicates
    else:
        add num to seen
return duplicates

🧩 Python Code
def find_duplicates(nums):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = []
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            duplicates.append(num)
        else:
            seen.add(num)
    return duplicates

print(find_duplicates([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]))  # Output: [2, 3]

⚙️ Approach 2: In-Place Swapping (O(1) Space)

If we can modify the array, we can mark visited numbers by flipping their corresponding index value negative.

def find_duplicates(nums):
    duplicates = []
    for num in nums:
        index = abs(num) - 1
        if nums[index] < 0:
            duplicates.append(abs(num))
        else:
            nums[index] = -nums[index]
    return duplicates

print(find_duplicates([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]))  # Output: [2, 3]

🌍 Real-World Example

Imagine you’re building a task tracking app.
You allow users to upload a list of task IDs from a CSV file.
You need to check if the same task was added more than once.

task_ids = [101, 204, 305, 204, 509, 101]
duplicates = find_duplicates(task_ids)
print("Duplicate Task IDs:", duplicates)
# Output: Duplicate Task IDs: [204, 101]
